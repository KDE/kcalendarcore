TODO: KDE5:

This API needs serious cleaning up:
- Most (all) methods aren't async ( deleteIncidence(), addIncidence(), load(), save(), ... )
  so it's not very easy to make a derived class that loads from akonadi.

- It has too many methods. Why do we need fooEvent()/fooJournal()/fooTodo() when fooIncidence()
  should be enough.

  @brief
  Represents the main calendar class.

  A calendar contains information like incidences (events, to-dos, journals),
  alarms, time zones, and other useful information.

  This is an abstract base class defining the interface to a calendar.
  It is implemented by subclasses like MemoryCalendar, which use different
  methods to store and access the data.

  <b>Ownership of Incidences</b>:

  Incidence ownership is handled by the following policy: as soon as an
  incidence (or any other subclass of IncidenceBase) is added to the
  Calendar by an add...() method it is owned by the Calendar object.
  The Calendar takes care of deleting the incidence using the delete...()
  methods. All Incidences returned by the query functions are returned
  as pointers so that changes to the returned Incidences are immediately
  visible in the Calendar.  Do <em>Not</em> attempt to 'delete' any Incidence
  object you get from Calendar -- use the delete...() methods.
