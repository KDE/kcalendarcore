  @brief
  Represents a span of time measured in seconds or days.

  A duration is a span of time measured in seconds or days.  Construction can
  be done by specifying a stop and end time, or simply by specifying the number
  of seconds or days.

  Much of the time, it does not matter whether a duration is specified in
  seconds or in days. But it does make a difference when a duration is used to
  define a time period encompassing a daylight saving time change.
