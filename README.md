# KCalCore

This library provides access to and handling of calendar data.
It supports the standard formats iCalendar and vCalendar and the
group scheduling standard iTIP.

A calendar contains information like incidences (events, to-dos, journals),
alarms, time zones, and other useful information.  This API provides
access to that calendar information via well known calendar formats
[iCalendar (or iCal)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icalendar) and the oolder
[vCalendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCalendar).
 
Credit goes to Eric Bossum \<eric@softwarestudio.org\> for his libical
software that does most of the heavy-lifting of the iCalendar support
that is abstracted by this API.
